# INHAE | Affective Epistemics & Symbolic Field Theory

This repository contains the canonical theoretical documents of the **Institute for a New Humanism through Adaptive Ethics (INHAE)**. These works formalize the **Affective Epistemics** framework, which models belief formation as a recursive modulation process within symbolic environments.

## Canonical Core

- `ae_7_0_complete.md` — **Affective Epistemics v7.0**: Complete Canonical Framework (Layers 1–5 + Theorems + Glossary)
- `ae6_2_framework.md` — Affective Epistemics v6.2: Prior Version (Ontological Structure)
- `ae6_2_math_model.md` — Formal Model: Early Mathematical Framing of Symbolic Modulation
- `ae6_2_sft_paper.md` — Symbolic Field Theory: Initial Applied Paper on Field Dynamics and Observation

## Purpose

These texts define a recursive framework for understanding belief as a dynamically rendered, affectively modulated event within symbolic space. The framework integrates ontology, epistemology, and field theory to model how subjects resolve meaning and modulate agency under symbolic pressure.

The materials are intended for researchers, theorists, designers, educators, symbolic systems analysts, and cultural critics navigating **post-coherence environments**.
